# SunnyNet
**SunnyNet** is a C# library to allow communication with your PV system via the SunnyPortal.
## Installation
Download the [library](https://github.com/DiegoVillagrasa/SunnyNet/blob/master/SunnyNet/bin/Release/SunnyNet.dll?raw=true) and include it into your .NET project
## Usage
Create a new interface using ```SunnyNetInterface interface = new SunnyNetInterface();```
Login using your SunnyPortal credentials ```interface.Connect("username", "password");```

* Get realtime watts generated ```interface.getWatts();```

To access archived data, you'll first need to initialize the inverters ```interface.openInverter();``` and set the date of the request ```interface.setDate("day", "month", "year");```

You can then:
* Get a CSV file of the requested day ```interface.requestValuesFile("name_of_the_file");```
* Get the watts produced that day in a double array ```interface.requestValues();```

**Experimental**
You can use ```setDateMonth()``` and ```sateDateYear()``` to request data for a specified period.
